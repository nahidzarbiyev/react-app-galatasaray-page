            History
          </h4>
          <span>
            Association football was first played in Istanbul by some British
            players in a field known as Papazın Çayırı ("Priest's Field") in the
            area that is now the site of Fenerbahçe's Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium.
            With the opening of the Taksim Stadium in 1921, it was this new
            stadium that became the new football headquarters. In the urban
            development of 1939, the military barracks in which the Taksim
            Stadium was located was demolished in 1940. The stadium was thus
            lost. In this period, Fenerbahçe bought the land encompassing
            Papazın Çayırı and built the Fenerbahçe Stadium, while the Beşiktaş
            Club moved into the Şeref Stadium, located in the area where today's
            Çırağan Palace Hotel stands. It was Galatasaray that experienced the
            biggest problem with the use of a stadium in that period. The first
            steps to overcome this problem were taken in the initial years of
            the 1930s. The first initiative to acquire a plot of land for
            Galatasaray was in 1933, when the then president of the club Ali
            Haydar Barşal showed an interest in a mulberry orchard in
            Mecidiyeköy. In the period between 1933 and 1935, negotiations with
            the government resulted in the allocation of a plot of land outside
            of the city limits in Mecidiye Köyü (Mecidiye Village, present-day
            Mecidiyeköy quarter of the Şişli district) for a stadium to be built
            for Galatasaray. Excavations for the construction began in 1936. The
            President of the Turkish Sports Organization at the time, Adnan
            Menderes, provided financial assistance for the project. However,
            the efforts were left in the excavation stage. In 1940, the matter
            of the stadium came up again under the presidency of Tevfik Ali
            Çınar. The same plot of land was leased to Galatasaray for a term of
            30 years at a symbolic yearly rental fee of 1 lira. Galatasaray thus
            acquired the right to the use of the land. In leasing the land,
            Galatasaray committed to building a modern stadium as well as a
            bicycle velodrome. The construction could not start, however, due to
            limited funds and the general atmosphere of the war years. In 1943,
            Osman Dardağan led an initiative to build a modest stadium that
            would answer the immediate need. In the atmosphere of war, only a
            small open tribune was allowed in the stadium, which was set on a
            field of earth and inaugurated under the presidency of Muslihittin
            Peykoğlu in 1945. However, its distance from the city center in
            those days, its inaccessibility by public transportation, and the
            rough winds that characterized the district were factors that
            contributed to a long period in which the stadium would lay idle and
            football games never took place. When the İnönü Stadium in the
            center of the city was opened in that period, Galatasaray abandoned
            the stadium building project in Mecidiyeköy, putting the project
            aside before fruition. In 1955, 30 more years were added to the
            right of utilization agreement, which at the time had 22 years to
            go, extending the terms until 2007. When the Club failed to
            undertake the building of the Stadium, the project was taken on by
            the Physical Education General Directorate. The construction started
            in 1959. In 1961, during the presidency of Refik Selimoğlu, a new
            agreement was signed with the Physical Education General Directorate
            whereby the utilization rights of the newly completed stadium were
            explicitly given to Galatasaray. The stadium was opened on an
            eventful December 20, 1964. In the midst of the extreme crowds
            present, panic broke out, resulting in the death of one spectator
            and the injury of 80 others. In 1965, the stadium was illuminated
            for the first time. Despite this, however, not many night games were
            played. At the beginning of the 1970s, the stadium was abandoned for
            another period during which the İnönü Stadium began to be used
            again. In the 1970s, the stadium was mostly used by Galatasaray for
            training sessions. In those years, it remained in a squalid state of
            neglect. In 1981, grass was planted on the field and the stadium was
            opened again. The lighting system was renewed in 1993, after which
            night games began to be played once more. In the same year, the
            system of combined tickets was initiated in Turkey at the Ali Sami
            Yen Stadium. Also in the same year, the stadium was furnished with
            seats to replace the old benches. The capacity of the stadium was
            thus reduced from 35,000 to an all-seater capacity of 22,000. In
            1997, the Galatasaray administration assigned a Canadian
            architectural firm for the task of designing Turkey's first
            multi-function, modern stadium to be built in place of the Ali Sami
            Yen Stadium, which was planned to be torn down. On 10 December 2013,
            a UEFA Champions League match between Galatasaray and Juventus had
            to be abandoned due to heavy snow in the 32nd minute with the score
            0–0, the remaining minutes of the match were played the next day.

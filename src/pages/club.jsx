        Founding Ali Sami Yen On October 30, 1905, Ali Sami Yen, speaking with
        his friends during Mehmet Ata Bey's lecture at Mekteb-i Sultani, decides
        to establish a football club. In partnership with Asım Sonumut, Reşat
        Şirvani, Refik Cevdet Kalpakçıoğlu, Abidin Daver and Kamil Ulus Bey;
        Galatasaray Sports Club is established under the chairmanship of Refik
        Cevdet Kalpakçıoğlu. During this period, a penny was collected from the
        players every week, and the president, Ali Sami Yen, took care of the
        soccer ball. Even when the soccer ball cleaned with lard was damaged;
        Ali Sami Yen cut a piece of his shoe and made a patch. Cevdet
        Kalpakçıoğlu also washed the jerseys. It was requested that the club's
        first name be Gloria or Audace; however, when the team beat its Greek
        opponent 2-0 in the first match played, the current name was born when
        the audience referred to them as "Galata Palace Masters". A word uttered
        by Ali Sami Yen; It will determine the foundation and purpose of
        existence of Galatasaray Sports Club:

        Galatasaray's first emblem; It featured a winged eagle carrying a soccer
        ball in its mouth. However, when this composition, drawn by Şevki Ege, a
        student of Galatasaray High School, was not adopted, it was pushed
        aside. Today's emblem was drawn in 1923 by Ayatollah Emin, another high
        school student. The new drawing included the letters "GS" in yellow-red
        colors intertwined with the harmonious use of geometric lines. This
        composition, which was first used in a weekly magazine published by
        Ayatollah Emin and Şinasi Şahingiray, was highly appreciated. Thereupon,
        a proposal was made for it to be accepted as the official emblem. The
        proposal was unanimously accepted amid applause. The old letters Gayın
        and Sin were replaced by the letters G and S with the transition to the
        Latin alphabet later on. It also bears the letters G and S and was
        crested 5 years after the team was founded.

      The first colors of Galatasaray Sports Club are red and white. These
      colors, inspired by the colors of the Turkish flag, were met with
      suspicion by the administration of the period and the players were
      followed closely. For this reason, yellow-black colors came to the agenda,
      but they were not permanent and Galatasaray gained its current colors. Ali
      Sami Yen explains the story of these colors as follows:
      </span>
      <blockquote className="italic text-gs-yellow text-sm w-[50%] m-auto">
      “After visiting
      many places, we finally went to Fat Yanko's shop in Bahçekapı and came
      across two elegant woolen fabrics. One is a deep sweet red with a hint of
      cherry, and the other is a rich yellow with traces of orange in it. The
      clerk combined the waves of the fabrics with a deft hand gesture. There
      was a brightness similar to the color beauty created by the head and wing
      of a goldfinch. We seemed to see the color plays in the fire. We
      envisioned the Yellow-Red flame shining on our team and envisioned it
      would take us from win to win immediately. As a matter of fact, it
      happened. „</blockquote>
      <span className="text-white p-10 w-[70%] text-center  flex m-auto">
       On the other hand, Bekir Sıtkı, one of the founders, stated
      that the colors in question were used in Gül Baba's II. He claims that he
      was inspired by the yellow and red roses he gave to Bayezid.
